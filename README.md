# Sentiment-Analysis-Web-App


Deploying a Sentiment Analysis Model using SageMaker

The notebook and Python files provided here, once completed, result in a simple web app which interacts with a deployed recurrent neural network performing sentiment analysis on movie reviews. This project assumes some familiarity with SageMaker, the mini-project, Sentiment Analysis using XGBoost, should provide enough background.


Project Overview

The project was created in Amazon SageMaker. The goal of this project was to create a simple web page, to enter a movie review. The web page will then send the review off to my deployed model which will predict the sentiment of the entered review. The output of the model says if the review was positive or negative.
